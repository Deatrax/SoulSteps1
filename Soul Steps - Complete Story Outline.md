## Act 1: A Fading Town
Introduction: The game opens with Elian's monologue about Aethelgard, a town that feels like it's slowly drying up, both literally and figuratively. The player is guided through basic movement controls.

- First Ethical Choice (The Beggar): On his way to his first job, Elian is approached by a beggar.

    - Path A: Give Money. Elian gives the beggar a small amount of money. (Kindness Up)

    - Path B: Refuse. Elian says he doesn't have any to spare. (Kindness Down)

Ethical Encounters in Town: As Elian walks to his job, he encounters several optional situations:

- The Defaced Mural (SDG 11: Sustainable Cities): Teens are about to spray paint a public mural.

    - Choice A: Intervene. (Kindness Up)

    - Choice B: Ignore them. (Kindness Down)

On his way to his Second  job, 

- The Stolen Bread (SDG 2: Zero Hunger): A person steals bread from a struggling baker.

    - Choice A: Pay for the bread. (Kindness Up)

    - Choice B: Help the baker. (Neutral)

    - Choice C: Do Nothing. (Kindness Down)

- The Leaking Canister (SDG 3: Good Health): A potentially hazardous canister is leaking near a public fountain.

    - Choice A: Report it. (Kindness Up)

    - Choice B: Push it away. (Slight Kindness Down)

**The Jobs**: Elian goes to two jobs, both requiring him to fix pipes. This introduces the Pipes Minigame.

**The Discovery**: On his second job, at the home of an elderly woman named Lena, Elian discovers an illegal "limiter" device on her water main.

- Path A: Exploit the Situation. Elian can pretend to fix the pipes without removing the limiter. This allows him to be called back repeatedly, earning more money but leaving Lena to suffer. (Kindness Sharply Down) If the player does this more than three times, the Kindness Bar will fully deplete, resulting in a Game Over.

- Path B: Investigate. Elian removes the limiter and decides to investigate its origin. This is the main story path.

## Act 2: The Conspiracy Unfolds
The Threat: Elian takes the limiter to the Veridia Dynamics office to report it. He is met with hostility and veiled threats, telling him to drop the matter.

The Hurt Man: As Elian leaves the office, he sees a man who appears to be hurt and in distress, trying to avoid Veridia security.

- Path A: Help the Man. Elian offers to help the man, who introduces himself as Kael. He asks Elian to help him find his dropped car keys before security finds him. This triggers an Object Finder Minigame. In return for his help, Kael takes Elian to a mechanic shop where he reveals the truth: he's a former Veridia engineer who was trying to leak data about a secret lab under the new resort. As he finishes explaining, they are attacked by Veridia agents. (Combat 1)

- Path B: Ignore the Man. Elian walks away, and the man is quickly apprehended by Veridia security. Feeling uneasy, Elian continues to investigate alone. Near a trash bin, he hears shouts and finds a discarded file containing blueprints for the limiter and a hidden lab. This triggers an Object Finder Minigame to piece together the shredded documents. As he picks up the final piece, he is spotted by Veridia agents. (Combat 1)

## Act 3: The Resort Lab
The Infiltration: The story now branches based on the player's choice in Act 2.

- Path A (Team-Up): Elian and Kael, having fought off the agents, decide to infiltrate the hidden Veridia Lab located beneath the luxury resort. Their goal is to find the central server and shut down the water siphoning system. The infiltration involves:

Cooperative Puzzles: Requiring both characters to work together.

Hacking Minigames: Played as Kael to disable security.

Stealth Gameplay.

- Path B (Solo): Elian, now a target, decides to infiltrate the lab alone using the blueprints he found. The infiltration is more difficult:

All security systems are active.

Elian must solve more complex Pipe Minigames to bypass security.

Deep inside the lab, Elian finds Kael locked in a detention cell.

- Choice A: Free Kael. This triggers an alarm but gives Elian a knowledgeable ally for the rest of the mission. (Kindness Up) They team up, and the story merges with Path A.

- Choice B: Leave Kael. Elian proceeds alone, but his actions weigh heavily on him. (Kindness Sharply Down)

The Core: Elian (and possibly Kael) reaches the lab's central control room. They find the server with all the incriminating data and the master controls for the water system. They are confronted by the lead Veridia enforcer. (Final Boss Combat)

The Final Choice: After defeating the enforcer, Elian must decide what to do.

- Path 1 (Justice): Shut down the system and leak all the data to the public. The town is saved, but Elian and Kael become fugitives. (High Kindness Ending)

- Path 2 (Compromise): Use the data as blackmail to force Veridia to restore the town's water supply. The immediate problem is solved, but the corrupt corporation remains in power. (Neutral Ending)

- Path 3 (Revenge): Sabotage the system, reversing the flow and flooding the resort, but also contaminating the entire region's water supply. Veridia is ruined, but so is the town. (Low Kindness Ending)
